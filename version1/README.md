# To-Do List Console Application

## Project Description
The objective of this project is to develop a console-based application in Java that allows users to manage a to-do list. The application enables users to add, delete, read, and mark tasks as completed (CRUD operations). The development will be carried out without using object-oriented programming principles, meaning no classes or objects will be used. All logic will be handled using primitive data structures and functions.

## Project Context
In the context of promoting effective time management and personal efficiency, the creation of a task organizer in Java has been proposed. This application will provide users with a simple tool to manage and track their daily tasks.

## Features
- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks to their to-do list.
- **Read Tasks**: Users can view the list of current tasks.
- **Update Tasks**: Users can mark tasks as completed or uncompleted.
- **Delete Tasks**: Users can delete tasks from the list.
- **Quit**: Users can exit the application.

## Code Structure
The main components of the application are as follows:
- **Main Class**: The entry point of the application, which initializes the application and displays the main menu.
- **Task Management Methods**: Methods to create, read, update, and delete tasks.

## Usage
To run the application, execute the `main` method. The application will display a menu with the following options:

1. Create Tasks
2. Read Tasks
3. Update Tasks
4. Remove Tasks
5. Quit

Users can select an option by entering the corresponding number.
